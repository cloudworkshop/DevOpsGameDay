Creating SSL certificates is a common task done in web application
infrastructures, so a rake task is provided to generate certificates.
These certificates are stored here by the ssl_cert task. To generate a
certificate set for a new monitoring server, for example:

    rake ssl_cert FQDN=monitoring.example.com
