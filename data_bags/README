Create data bag JSON files in subdirectories by data bag name. Then
upload the items to the Chef Server with knife:

    knife data bag from file BAG FILE

For example, create a bag named 'apps' with an item named 'instiki':

    mkdir data_bags/apps
    echo '{ "id": "instiki" }' > data_bags/apps/instiki.json

Then upload it to the server:

    knife data bag from file apps instiki.json
