/**
 * Introduction to HyperDB configuration
 *
 * HyperDB can manage connections to a large number of databases. Queries are
 * distributed to appropriate servers by mapping table names to datasets.
 *
 * A dataset is defined as a group of tables that are located in the same
 * database. There may be similarly-named databases containing different
 * tables on different servers. There may also be many replicas of a database
 * on different servers. The term "dataset" removes any ambiguity. Consider a
 * dataset as a group of tables that can be mirrored on many servers.
 *
 * Configuring HyperDB involves defining databases and datasets. Defining a
 * database involves specifying the server connection details, the dataset it
 * contains, and its capabilities and priorities for reading and writing.
 * Defining a dataset involves specifying its exact table names or registering
 * one or more callback functions that translate table names to datasets.
 */


/** Variable settings **/

/**
 * save_queries (bool)
 * This is useful for debugging. Queries are saved in $wpdb->queries. It is not
 * a constant because you might want to use it momentarily.
 * Default: false
 */
$wpdb->save_queries = false;

/**
 * persistent (bool)
 * This determines whether to use mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect. The effects
 * of this setting may vary and should be carefully tested.
 * Default: false
 */
$wpdb->persistent = false;

/**
 * max_connections (int)
 * This is the number of mysql connections to keep open. Increase if you expect
 * to reuse a lot of connections to different servers. This is ignored if you
 * enable persistent connections.
 * Default: 10
 */
$wpdb->max_connections = 10;

/**
 * tcp_responsiveness_check
 * Enables checking TCP responsiveness by fsockopen prior to mysql_connect or
 * mysql_pconnect. This was added because PHP's mysql functions do not provide
 * a variable timeout setting. Disabling it may improve average performance by
 * a very tiny margin but lose protection against connections failing slowly.
 * Default: true
 */
$wpdb->tcp_responsiveness_check = true;

/** Configuration Functions **/

/**
 * $wpdb->add_database( $database );
 *
 * $database is an associative array with these parameters:
 * host     (required) Hostname with optional :port. Default port is 3306.
 * user     (required) MySQL user name.
 * password (required) MySQL user password.
 * name     (required) MySQL database name.
 * read     (optional) Whether server is readable. Default is 1 (readable).
 *                     Also used to assign preference. See "Network topology".
 * write    (optional) Whether server is writable. Default is 1 (writable).
 *                     Also used to assign preference in multi-master mode.
 * dataset  (optional) Name of dataset. Default is 'global'.
 * timeout  (optional) Seconds to wait for TCP responsiveness. Default is 0.2
 */

/**
 * $wpdb->add_table( $dataset, $table );
 *
 * $dataset and $table are strings.
 */

/**
 * $wpdb->add_callback( $callback );
 *
 * $callback is a callable function or method. It will be called with two
 * arguments and expected to compute a dataset or return null.
 * $dataset = $callback($table, &$wpdb);
 *
 * Callbacks are executed in the order in which they are registered until one
 * of them returns something other than null. Anything evaluating to false will
 * cause the query to be aborted.
 *
 * For more complex setups, the callback may be used to overwrite properties of
 * $wpdb or variables within hyperdb::connect_db(). If a callback returns an
 * array, HyperDB will extract the array. It should be an associative array and
 * it should include a $dataset value corresponding to a database added with
 * $wpdb->add_database(). It may also include $server, which will be extracted
 * to overwrite the parameters of each randomly selected database server prior
 * to connection. This allows you to dynamically vary parameters such as the
 * host, user, password, database name, and TCP check timeout.
 */


/** Masters and slaves
 *
 * A database definition can include 'read' and 'write' parameters. These
 * operate as boolean switches but they are typically specified as integers.
 * They allow or disallow use of the database for reading or writing.
 *
 * A master database might be configured to allow reading and writing:
 *   'write' => 1,
 *   'read'  => 1,
 * while a slave would be allowed only to read:
 *   'write' => 0,
 *   'read'  => 1,
 *
 * It might be advantageous to disallow reading from the master, such as when
 * there are many slaves available and the master is very busy with writes.
 *   'write' => 1,
 *   'read'  => 0,
 * HyperDB accommodates slave replication lag somewhat by keeping track of the
 * tables that it has written since instantiation and sending subsequent read
 * queries to the same server that received the write query. Thus a master set
 * up this way will still receive read queries, but only subsequent to writes.
 */


/**
 * Network topology / Datacenter awareness
 *
 * When your databases are located in separate physical locations there is
 * typically an advantage to connecting to a nearby server instead of a more
 * distant one. The read and write parameters can be used to place servers into
 * logical groups of more or less preferred connections. Lower numbers indicate
 * greater preference.
 *
 * This configuration instructs HyperDB to try reading from one of the local
 * slaves at random. If that slave is unreachable or refuses the connection,
 * the other slave will be tried, followed by the master, and finally the
 * remote slaves in random order.
 * Local slave 1:   'write' => 0, 'read' => 1,
 * Local slave 2:   'write' => 0, 'read' => 1,
 * Local master:    'write' => 1, 'read' => 2,
 * Remote slave 1:  'write' => 0, 'read' => 3,
 * Remote slave 2:  'write' => 0, 'read' => 3,
 *
 * In the other datacenter, the master would be remote. We would take that into
 * account while deciding where to send reads. Writes would always be sent to
 * the master, regardless of proximity.
 * Local slave 1:   'write' => 0, 'read' => 1,
 * Local slave 2:   'write' => 0, 'read' => 1,
 * Remote slave 1:  'write' => 0, 'read' => 2,
 * Remote slave 2:  'write' => 0, 'read' => 2,
 * Remote master:   'write' => 1, 'read' => 3,
 *
 * There are many ways to achieve different configurations in different
 * locations. You can deploy different config files. You can write code to
 * discover the web server's location, such as by inspecting $_SERVER or
 * php_uname(), and compute the read/write parameters accordingly. An example
 * appears later in this file using the legacy function add_db_server().

 * This is back-compatible with an older config style. It is for convenience.
 * lhost, part, and dc were removed from hyperdb because the read and write
 * parameters provide enough power to achieve the desired effects via config.
 *
 * @param string $dataset Datset: the name of the dataset. Just use "global" if you don't need horizontal partitioning.
 * @param int $part Partition: the vertical partition number (1, 2, 3, etc.). Use "0" if you don't need vertical partitioning.
 * @param string $dc Datacenter: where the database server is located. Airport codes are convenient. Use whatever.
 * @param int $read Read group: tries all servers in lowest number group before trying higher number group. Typical: 1 for slaves, 2 for master. This will cause reads to go to slaves unless all slaves are unreachable. Zero for no reads.
 * @param bool $write Write flag: is this server writable? Works the same as $read. Typical: 1 for master, 0 for slaves.
 * @param string $host Internet address: host:port of server on internet. 
 * @param string $lhost Local address: host:port of server for use when in same datacenter. Leave empty if no local address exists.
 * @param string $name Database name.
 * @param string $user Database user.
